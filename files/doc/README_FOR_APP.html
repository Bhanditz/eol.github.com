            <h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>
            <p>
            Welcome to the Encyclopedia of Life project. The bulk of the code needed to
            run <a href="http://www.eol.org">www.eol.org</a> is written in Ruby on
            Rails and is made available to anyone for re-use, repurposing or for
            improvement. This is both an ambitious project and an ambitious codebase
            and we are excited to share it with the open source community. The code has
            been under development since approximately September 2007, but has
            undergone many revisions and updates from June 2008-December 2008. There is
            much work to be done, both in adding new features, and in the ongoing
            process of code refactoring and performance improvements. If you see
            something you like, share it with your colleagues and friends and reuse it
            in your own projects. If you see something you don&#8217;t like, help us
            fix it or join the discussion at the &#8220;Developers&#8221; forum at <a
            href="http://forum.eol.org">forum.eol.org</a>, or on GitHub or Google Code.
            </p>
            <h2>LICENSE</h2>
            <p>
            The full code base is released under the MIT <a
            href="../../classes/License.html">License</a>. Details are available in the
            &#8220;MIT-LICENSE.txt&#8220; file at the root of the code folder.
            </p>
            <h2>GETTING STARTED</h2>
            <p>
            This is a big Rails project. Clearly, some of the installation steps below
            are big and require multiple steps, but if you are currently a Rails
            developer, some are already done (like installing Ruby). If you are not a
            Rails developer, we suggest you first visit <a
            href="http://www.rubyonrails.org">www.rubyonrails.org</a> for more
            information on getting started with Rails and then return to us when you
            have your feet wet. The <a href="http://www.eol.org">www.eol.org</a>
            codebase probably shouldn&#8217;t be the first Rails project you&#8217;ve
            ever seen.
            </p>
            <p>
            For seasoned Rails developers, you&#8217;ll also notice the codebase does
            some mix and matching &#8212; both restful controllers and regular
            controllers, both ERB and HAML. We like the restful way of doing things and
            plan to move in that direction. HAML vs ERB is still an open topic for
            discussion, although we are sticking with ERB until it&#8217;s settled.
            </p>
            <h3>INSTALLATION</h3>
            <p>
            To get things up and running, these are the steps you need to take. If you
            actually run through this process, please update this list with any changes
            you notice being necessary!
            </p>
            <p>
            Note that many of these steps require root access on your machine. You have
            been warned and may need to run them as &#8220;sudo&#8221; on a Mac/Linux
            or as an administrator on Windows (there, I acknowledged the existence of
            Windows).
            </p>
            <h3>FIRST THINGS FIRST</h3>
            <ol>
            <li>Install Ruby and the Rails framework on your local machine (<a
            href="http://www.ruby-lang.org">www.ruby-lang.org</a> and <a
            href="http://www.rubyonrails.org">www.rubyonrails.org</a>).
            
            </li>
            <li>Install MySQL on your local machine (<a
            href="http://www.mysql.com">www.mysql.com</a>).
            
            </li>
            <li>Get the code from the public repository (<a
            href="http://repository.eol.org/eol">repository.eol.org/eol</a>) or GitHub.
            
            </li>
            </ol>
            <p>
            Next, continue with the following sections: &#8220;INSTALLING REQUIRED
            GEMS&#8221;, &#8220;SETTING UP THE DATABASES&#8221;, &#8220;MAKING SURE IT
            REALLY WORKS&#8220;
            </p>
            <h3>INSTALLING REQUIRED GEMS</h3>
            <p>
            The following gems are required on your local machine for development but
            NOT deployment (deployment gems should always be frozen into the project):
            </p>
            <ol>
            <li>ZenTest
            
            </li>
            <li>ruby-debug
            
            </li>
            <li>piston
            
            </li>
            <li>hpricot
            
            </li>
            </ol>
            <p>
            If you are on a Mac, you will also need ruby-growl. &#8230; well, if you
            want to run autotest, you will.
            </p>
            <p>
            Plugins required to run the site in production should be frozen into the
            vendor folder as is the version of Rails the app depends on.
            </p>
            <p>
            To install required gems:
            </p>
            <pre>rake gems         # This could give you some errors...&#x000A;rake gems:build   # if there are gems that aren't installed or you got that big error...&#x000A;rake gems:install # if there were gems that are STILL missing...&#x000A;# please manually install gems that are still missing or failed to install.</pre>
            <h3>SETTING UP THE DATABASES</h3>
            <ol>
            <li>Setup the config/database.yml
            
            <ol>
            <li type="a">Copy &#8220;config/database.sample.yml&#8220; to
            &#8220;config/database.yml&#8220;
            
            </li>
            <li type="a">Create/update the appropriate entries for your development and test
            environments
            
            </li>
            <li type="a">For development purposes, the <tt>demo</tt>, <tt>integration</tt>, and
            <tt>production</tt> environments may be removed
            
            </li>
            <li type="a">For production purposes, set the &#8220;master_database&#8220; to the
            master database for the core rails database and the
            &#8220;master_data_database&#8220; to the master database for the data
            database (see more info below in the &#8220;READ/WRITE SPLITTING&#8221;
            topic)
            
            </li>
            </ol>
            </li>
            <li>Run the following rake commands:
            
            </li>
            </ol>
            <pre>rake eol:db:create:all           # Note the &quot;EOL&quot;.  This keeps bad things from happening.  Please use it.&#x000A;rake db:migrate&#x000A;rake spec:db:fixtures:load       # You need this or the next step will do nothing.&#x000A;rake denormal:build_random_taxa  # This populates the eolData database with data.&#x000A;rake db:migrate RAILS_ENV=test7&#x000A;rake spec:db:fixtures:load RAILS_ENV=test&#x000A;rake denormal:build_random_taxa RAILS_ENV=test   # If you don't run this one, you will get more failures!&#x000A;rake eol:site_specific repo=URL  # Your &quot;URL&quot; (or an alternative) will be provided to you privately.</pre>
            <p>
            You may also need to make the &#8220;bin/recreate_databases&#8220; script
            executable, and then run it to automatically run all of those tasks above
            (assuming you are on a Mac/Linux).
            </p>
            <pre>./bin/recreate_databases</pre>
            <h3>WATCHING IT COME TO LIFE</h3>
            <pre>script/server</pre>
            <p>
            Go to <a href="http://localhost:3000">localhost:3000</a> and see stuff.
            </p>
            <h2>TESTING</h2>
            <p>
            We&#8217;re using RSpec for our testing (see the spec/ directory). For
            model tests, you can either use fixtures or ValidModelBuilder.
            </p>
            <h2>MULTI-DATABASE AND MASTER/SLAVE DATABASES SETUP</h2>
            <p>
            The site is built to allow for master/slave database read/write splitting
            for the core rails database and the core &#8220;data&#8221; database. There
            are two plugins involved in the use of multiple databases and read/write
            splitting:
            </p>
            <ul>
            <li>use_db : used to direct some models to a different database (<a
            href="http://rails.elctech.com/blog/using-and-testing-rails-with-multiple-databases">rails.elctech.com/blog/using-and-testing-rails-with-multiple-databases</a>)
            
            </li>
            <li>masochism : used to split read/writes when using <a
            href="../../classes/ActiveRecord.html">ActiveRecord</a> (<a
            href="http://www.planetrubyonrails.org/tags/view/masochism">www.planetrubyonrails.org/tags/view/masochism</a>)
            
            </li>
            </ul>
            <h3>MULTIPLE DATABASES</h3>
            <p>
            New abstract class models are created which make connections to the other
            databases required, and then any models which need to connect to the other
            databases are subclassed from the new abstract class. In our case, we have
            two abstract classes representing connections to the data database and the
            logging database:
            </p>
            <ul>
            <li><a href="../../classes/SpeciesSchemaModel.html">SpeciesSchemaModel</a>
            
            </li>
            <li><a href="../../classes/LoggingModel.html">LoggingModel</a>
            
            </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
            These extra two databases are referenced in the database.yml in the
            following way:
            </p>
            <ul>
            <li>environment_data (e.g. development_data)
            
            </li>
            <li>environment_logging (e.g. development_logging)
            
            </li>
            </ul>
            <h3>READ/WRITE SPLITTING</h3>
            <p>
            Read/write splitting is accomplished with the masochism plugin by adding
            two new database connections to the config/database.yml file:
            </p>
            <ul>
            <li>master_database (the master database connection for the core rails
            database)
            
            </li>
            <li>master_data_database (the master database connection for the
            &#8220;data&#8221; database)
            
            </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
            In addition there are new abstract classes representing a connection to
            each master database that can be used to run direct SQL queries against the
            masters:
            </p>
            <ul>
            <li>MasterDatabase (for the core rails database)
            
            </li>
            <li><a href="../../classes/SpeciesSchemaWriter.html">SpeciesSchemaWriter</a>
            (for the species data database)
            
            </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
            The logging database does not require read/write splitting since there is
            only a single server for this purpose.
            </p>
            <p>
            To enable read/write splitting via <a
            href="../../classes/ActiveRecord.html">ActiveRecord</a>, include the
            following in the approriate environment.rb file (e.g.
            config/environments/production.rb):
            </p>
            <pre>config.after_initialize do&#x000A;  ActiveReload::ConnectionProxy.setup!&#x000A;  ActiveReload::ConnectionProxy.setup_for SpeciesSchemaWriter, SpeciesSchemaModel&#x000A;end</pre>
            <p>
            Note that you <b>must</b> also enable class caching for this to work (this
            is the default in production, but not in development, which is important to
            note if you wish to test this functionality in development mode):
            </p>
            <pre>config.cache_classes = true</pre>
            <p>
            Manually crafted SQL queries with SELECT statement will be redirected to
            slave while all other queries like in the following example will be
            redirected to master:
            </p>
            <pre>SpeciesSchemaModel.connection.execute(&quot;DELETE FROM data_objects WHERE id in (#{data_objects})&quot;)</pre>
            <p>
            You don&#8217;t have to worry about master/slave databases in development
            mode unless you want to test your code against splitting queries. When in
            development, you could make the master_database and master_data_database
            must point to the same place as development and development_data
            respectively. Things should work even if these entries are left out (since
            the master databases are only connected in a configuration entry in the
            production environment) but it doesn&#8217;t hurt if they are there.
            </p>
            <h2>FINDING THINGS TODO</h2>
            <p>
            Spots in the code requiring some attention for refactoring, cleanup or
            further work are marked with a &#8220;TODO&#8221; comment and sometimes
            with a level of priority. You can quickly locate all these comments with
            your IDE, an app like TextMate, or with a rake command:
            </p>
            <pre>rake notes:todo</pre>
            <h2>USERS/ROLES/RIGHTS</h2>
            <p>
            The site is using the acl_system plugin (<a
            href="http://brainspl.at/articles/2006/02/20/new-plugin-acl_system">brainspl.at/articles/2006/02/20/new-plugin-acl_system</a>).
            </p>
            <p>
            Basically:
            </p>
            <ol>
            <li>Users can be assigned to zero or more roles.
            
            </li>
            <li>Controllers are restricted by role when needed.
            
            </li>
            </ol>
            <p>
            So you can protect controllers and actions in the following ways:
            </p>
            <ol>
            <li>To indicate a user must be logged in to view particular actions or
            controllers, just put this at the top of the controller (restricted to
            certain actions if you wish):
            
            <pre>before_filter :check_authentication</pre>
            <p>
            This does not perform any checks for roles, just does a simple logged in
            check and redirects to the login page if needed.
            </p>
            </li>
            <li>To indicate a user must have the rights to a particular controller, just
            put this at the top of the controller (restricted to certain actions if you
            wish):
            
            <pre>access_control :DEFAULT =&gt; 'ROLE NAME GOES HERE'</pre>
            <p>
            This checks to be sure the user has access rights to that controller (based
            on the role you specified) before letting them use actions in the
            controller. For more advanced control over only certain methods, see the
            acl_system2 plugin README.
            </p>
            </li>
            <li>A convenience controller/helper method is provided to check if a user is in
            a particular role called &#8220;is_user_in_role?&#8220;
            
            <p>
            For example:
            </p>
            <pre>do_this_method_only_for_admins if is_user_in_role?('Administrator')</pre>
            </li>
            <li>You can also use the built in acl plugin helpers to only show links or
            other snippets of code in your view based on roles membership.
            
            <p>
            For example:
            </p>
            <pre>&lt;% restrict_to &quot;(Administrator) &amp; !blacklist&quot; do %&gt; admin stuff here &lt;% end %&gt;</pre>
            </li>
            </ol>
            <h2>ADMINISTRATIVE SECTION</h2>
            <p>
            The admin section uses the roles setup described above. To create a new
            admin function:
            </p>
            <ol>
            <li>Create a new controller in the &#8220;administrator&#8221; folder under
            controllers, e.g. Administrator::NewContollerName
            
            </li>
            <li>Derive that controller from the Admin controller, e.g. class
            Administrator::NewContollerName < <a
            href="../../classes/AdminController.html">AdminController</a>
            
            </li>
            <li>Create your views in the correct subfolder under
            &#8220;views/administrator&#8220;, e.g.
            &#8220;views/administrator/new_controller_name&#8220;
            
            </li>
            <li>Decide if you need a new role to access this controller or if an existing
            role will suffice. Add the new role into the &#8220;roles&#8221; database
            if required (you can use the admin interface or a migration).
            
            </li>
            <li>At the top of your controller, restrict access to the role by adding the
            following line to the top:
            
            <pre>access_control :DEFAULT =&gt; 'ROLE NAME GOES HERE'</pre>
            <p>
            Note that by default, users must also have the generic
            &#8220;administrator&#8221; role to access any of the controllers derived
            from the main admin controller.
            </p>
            </li>
            <li>Add your new controller to the admin navigation menu by editing
            &#8220;views/admin/_navigation.html.erb&#8220; See the existing links for
            restricting the display of menu items to the specific role you have
            identified in step 5.
            
            </li>
            <li>Make sure you&#8217;ve got at least one admin user with access to the
            correct role, log in and test.
            
            </li>
            </ol>
            <h2>LOGGING</h2>
            <p>
            The logging model is intended to be thought of as a data mining system. A
            separate database is used to store all log data, which must be defined in
            your config/database.yml file. (See sample file for naming.) Models and
            operations tend to fall into two categories: dimensions and facts. In
            short, dimensions represent collected (primary) data. Facts are derived
            (secondary) caches of information which is more meaningful to the user.
            Fact table design is highly dependent on the user interface design, because
            we only need to generate facts if the information will actually be shown.
            For performance reasons regarding the expected database size, fact tables
            are also intended to be highly denormalized, non-authoritive sources of
            information.
            </p>
            <p>
            Location-based facts require the primary data to go through a geocoding
            process which requires an external web service. This process is thus
            performed asynchronously from the main site. Results of IP location lookups
            are cached and reused whenever possible. While IP location lookups are
            non-authoritative &#8220;best guesses&#8221;, they nevertheless provide
            meaningful information.
            </p>
            <p>
            In production mode it is CRITICALLY important to understand the automated
            logging tasks before invoking them to avoid deletion of precious data. To
            develop logging features, run the following tasks in the given order to
            populate your logging database with mock data...
            </p>
            <pre>rake logging:clear                                                       # Deletes all logging-related records. (WARNING: NEVER run this in production.)&#x000A;rake logging:dimension:mock THOUSANDS=2        # Creates 2,000 psedo-random mock log entries (a.k.a. primary data).&#x000A;rake logging:geocode:all                                             # Performs geocoding on the primary data, using caches where possible.&#x000A;rake logging:fact:all                                                  # Derives secondary data from primary data.</pre>
            <p>
            &#8230;at this point you should see data in the graph pages of the web
            application. Alternatively, run the following which does all of the above
            in one step....
            </p>
            <pre>script/runner script/logging_mock</pre>
            <p>
            For cron jobs, you&#8217;ll likely want to log all facts for a particular
            date range:
            </p>
            <pre>rake logging:fact:today&#x000A;rake logging:fact:yesterday&#x000A;rake logging:fact:range FROM='01/15/2007' TO='12/19/2008'</pre>
            <h2>EXTERNAL LINK TRACKING</h2>
            <p>
            Any links to external sites that need to be tracked should use the
            following two helpers:
            </p>
            <pre>eol_return_linked_text(text,url)      # (aliased as link_text as well)&#x000A;eol_return_linked_image(image,url)</pre>
            <p>
            Both will generate a link (with either the supplied text or the supplied
            image url) to the supplied URL. The link will be logged in the database,
            and if the $USE_EXTERNAL_LINK_POPUPS parameter is set to TRUE in the
            environment.rb file, a javascript pop-up warning window is shown prior to
            following the link. The following additional parameters can be passed after
            the URL for both methods:
            </p>
            <pre>:new_window=&gt;true or false -- determines if link appears in new browser window (defaults to true)&#x000A;:show_only_if_link=&gt;true or false -- determines if image or text is shown if no URL was supplied (defaults to false)&#x000A;:show_link_icon=&gt;true or false -- determines if the external icon image is shown after the link (defaults to true for text links and false for image links)</pre>
            <p>
            For images, the following parameters can also be passed:
            </p>
            <pre>:alt=&gt;'value' -- alt tag is set with the value passed&#x000A;:title=&gt;'value' -- title tag is set with the value passed</pre>
            <p>
            Currently no reports are provided for external link tracking, all links are
            stored in the &#8220;external_link_logs&#8220; in the logging database for
            later reporting.
            </p>
            <h2>FRAGMENT CACHING</h2>
            <p>
            Fragment caching is enabled in the specific environment file (e.g.
            config/production.rb) and the storage mechanism (i.e. memcached) must be
            set as well.
            </p>
            <p>
            For memcahed:
            </p>
            <pre>config.cache_store = :mem_cache_store, '10.0.0.1:11211', '10.0.0.2:11211'</pre>
            <p>
            To enable caching:
            </p>
            <pre>config.action_controller.perform_caching             = true</pre>
            <p>
            All &#8220;static&#8221; pages coming out of the CMS are fragment cached
            and the home page cache is cleared each hour (or as set in the
            $CACHE_CLEAR_IN_HOURS value set in the config/environment.rb file), using
            language as key to enable multiple fragments. The header and footer
            navigation of each page is also fragment cached on cleared at the same time
            interval. When changes are made in the admin interface, these caches are
            automatically cleared.
            </p>
            <p>
            Names searches are cached by query type, language and vetted/non-vetted
            status.
            </p>
            <p>
            Species pages are cached using the following attributes as keys (since each
            will cause a different species page to be created). Note that when logged
            in as an administrator or content partner, the pages are not cached and are
            generated dynamically each time.
            </p>
            <p>
            Variables for naming species page fragment caches:
            </p>
            <ul>
            <li>taxon_id
            
            </li>
            <li>language
            
            </li>
            <li>expertise level
            
            </li>
            <li>vetted or all information
            
            </li>
            <li>default taxonomic browser
            
            </li>
            <li>curator for page
            
            </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
            Species page caches can be cleared by taxon ID by a CMS Site <a
            href="../../classes/Administrator.html">Administrator</a> by logging into
            the admin console, and going to &#8220;General Site Admin&#8221;. Clearing
            a species page cache automatically clears all of its ancestors as well.
            </p>
            <p>
            The following URLs can be used to trigger page expiration either manually
            in the browser or via a web service call. They only work if called from
            &#8220;allowed&#8221; IPs (i.e. as specified in configuration) as defined
            in the application level method &#8220;allowed_request&#8220; (which
            returns TRUE or FALSE).
            </p>
            <pre>localhost:3000/expire_all    # expire all non-species pages&#x000A;localhost:3000/expire_taxon/TAXON_ID  # expire specified taxon ID (and it's ancestors)&#x000A;localhost:3000/expire_taxa/?taxa_ids=ID1,ID2,ID3 # will expire a list of taxon IDs (and their unique ancestors) specified in the querystring (or post) parameter &quot;taxa_ids&quot; (separate by commas)&#x000A;localhost:3000/clear_caches # expire all fragment caches (if supported by data store mechanism)</pre>
            <p>
            From within the Rails applications, use the following application level
            methods:
            </p>
            <pre>expire_all   # expire all non-species pages&#x000A;expire_taxon(taxon_ID)  # expire specified taxon id and ancestors (unless :expire_ancestors=&gt;false is set)&#x000A;expire_taxa(taxon_ID_array)# expire specified array of taxon ID and unique ancestors (unless :expire_ancestors=&gt;false is set)&#x000A;clear_all_caches # expire all fragment caches (everything!)</pre>
            <p>
            For testing purposes, to install memcached on a Mac see <a
            href="http://readystate4.com/2008/08/19/installing-memcached-on-os-x-1054-leopard">readystate4.com/2008/08/19/installing-memcached-on-os-x-1054-leopard</a>/
            If you have a local memcached server installed (Mac/Linux), start it with:
            &#8220;memcached -d -m 24 -p 11211&#8221; and stop it with &#8220;killall
            memcached&#8220;
            </p>
            <h2>ASSETT PACKAGER (CSS and JS)</h2>
            <p>
            This is now using the asset_packager plugin, see details at <a
            href="http://synthesis.sbecker.net/pages/asset_packager">synthesis.sbecker.net/pages/asset_packager</a>
            </p>
            <p>
            If you add a javascript include files and you want them included in the
            page, you must edit the &#8220;config/asset_packager.yml&#8220; file and
            place them in the order you wish them to be loaded. When running in
            development mode, the JS and CSS are included separately each time. When
            running in production mode, assets are included from packaged entities. A
            rake task is used to combine and minify CSS and JS referenced. You must run
            this rake task each time the JS/CSS is updated to ensure the latest version
            is present when running in production mode. The minification process is
            very sensitive to missing semicolons, extra commas and what not that are
            dealt with by modern browsers (not IE though...). You have been warned -
            minification can and will break your JS if you are not careful!
            </p>
            <p>
            To update/create the combined versions:
            </p>
            <pre>rake asset:packager:build_all</pre>
            <p>
            In production, this rake command is run as part of the capistrano deploy
            script.
            </p>
            <h2>TAXONCONCEPT ATTRIBUTION NOTES</h2>
            <p>
            To get attribution for a given taxon concept ID:
